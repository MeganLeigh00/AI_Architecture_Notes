# Data Mining Techniques: Sequences, Time Series, and Data Streams

## 1. Formulating Real-World Data
- **Sequences**: Ordered lists of events or items.
  - Examples: Customer purchase histories, DNA sequences.
- **Time Series**: Data points indexed by time, such as stock prices or temperature readings.
  - Importance: Analyzing trends and patterns over time.
- **Data Streams**: Continuous flows of real-time data, such as sensor data or network traffic logs.
  - Challenge: Requires efficient processing due to volume and velocity.

## 2. Sequence Prediction Using N-Gram Models
- **N-Gram Language Models**:
  - Predict the next item in a sequence based on the preceding \( N-1 \) items.
- **Applications**:
  - Text prediction, machine translation, speech recognition.
- **Example**:
  - Predicting the next word in a sentence based on the previous words.

## 3. Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)
- **Fundamentals**:
  - Statistical models representing systems with hidden states.
- **Components**:
  - **States**: Hidden variables representing the system's status.
  - **Observations**: Visible data generated by the states.
  - **Transition Probabilities**: Likelihood of moving from one state to another.
- **Applications**:
  - Part-of-speech tagging, speech recognition, biological sequence analysis.

## 4. Extracting Patterns from Time Series Data
- **Types of Patterns**:
  - **Trends**: Long-term movements (e.g., increasing sales over years).
  - **Seasonal Patterns**: Regular fluctuations at specific intervals (e.g., holiday sales spikes).
  - **Cycles**: Long-term oscillations without fixed time frames (e.g., economic cycles).
  - **Outliers**: Significant deviations from the dataset.

## 5. Measuring Similarity Between Time Series
- **Similarity Measures**:
  - **Euclidean Distance**: Straight-line distance between two time series.
  - **Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)**: Aligns sequences with varying speeds.
  - **Correlation Coefficient**: Evaluates how closely two time series move together.

---

## 6. Time Series Forecasting
- **Autoregressive Models**:
  - Use past values to predict future ones (e.g., ARIMA).
- **Applications**:
  - Forecasting sales, demand, economic indicators.
- **Components**:
  - **AR (Autoregressive)**: Dependency on lagged observations.
  - **I (Integrated)**: Differencing raw observations to achieve stationarity.
  - **MA (Moving Average)**: Dependency on residual errors from a moving average model.

## 7. Mining Data Streams
- **Challenges**:
  - Continuous data generation limits the ability to store data for later analysis.
- **Mining Strategies**:
  - Use sampling techniques to approximate data characteristics.
  - Focus on algorithms that process data on-the-fly to handle dynamic streams.

---

## 8. Implementing Sampling and Filtering Techniques
- **Reservoir Sampling**: Randomly selects a sample from a stream of unknown size, ensuring equal probability for all items.
- **Bloom Filters**: Probabilistic data structure to test membership in a set, allowing false positives but no false negatives.
- **Lossy Counting**: Approximates the frequency of items in data streams while using limited memory.

## 9. Real-World Applications
- **E-Commerce**: Analyze customer purchasing sequences to improve marketing strategies.
- **Finance**: Forecast stock market trends and assess risks using time series data.
- **Healthcare**: Monitor patient vitals in real-time using data streams for critical care.
- **Manufacturing**: Perform predictive maintenance based on sensor time series data.
- **Social Media**: Analyze user interactions to detect trends and sentiment in real-time.
